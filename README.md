<h3> About the project </h3>

We started by implementing the class needed to manage the tasks,
then, we implemented a model to manage the tasks created.
After that, we implemented the controller to connect the methods
between the view and model. The last class we implemented was the
view, where all we implemented were the messages in console and
the reading of the user inputs.
